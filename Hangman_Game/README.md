# Hangman Game 🎮🍎

Welcome to the **Hangman Game**! This classic word-guessing game is built using Python. Your goal is to guess the hidden fruit name within 7 tries. For every incorrect guess, a part of a hangman figure will appear. If the figure completes, you lose the game. Guess the fruit name correctly within the given chances to win!

---

## How It Works

1. The program randomly selects one fruit name from a list of 50.
2. The chosen word is represented with dashes (`_`), where each dash corresponds to a letter in the word.
3. You can guess one letter at a time.
4. **Rules:**
   - For every wrong guess, part of a hangman figure appears.
   - You have 7 chances before the hangman figure is fully drawn.
   - If you guess the word before the hangman figure completes, you win!
5. The game runs in the console, providing an interactive and fun experience.
